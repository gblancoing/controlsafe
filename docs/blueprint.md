# **App Name**: SControlSafe

## Core Features:

- Hierarchical Management: Manage mining companies, regions, sites, subcontractors, and vehicle fleets in a hierarchical structure to reflect the organization's real structure.
- Torque Control: Record torque values for critical vehicle components (wheels, suspension, chassis), specifying required and applied values, the technician, and tool used.
- Maintenance Scheduling: Schedule preventive and predictive maintenance based on date, mileage, or usage hours, with configurable frequencies and advance notifications.
- Alert System: Set up automated alerts and notifications (via push, email) for upcoming reviews, overdue tasks, torque outside of the expected range, and vehicle status changes, targeting appropriate personnel.
- Offline Operation: Enable offline operation in remote areas with subsequent synchronization to maintain functionality and record data regardless of internet connectivity.
- Predictive Maintenance Advisor: AI tool that reviews the history of completed vehicle maintenance records to identify potential issues. The LLM will look for recurring problems, parts that need to be monitored or replaced more often than expected, and whether torque checks are performed as scheduled.
- Role-Based Access: Implement a role-based access control system to limit data access and actions based on the user's role (Administrator, Supervisor, Technician, Driver) to maintain security.

- A grid-based layout ensuring adaptability, enabling efficient scaling from desktop dashboards to mobile interfaces.
- Subtle transitions to signal actions, and status changes, guiding users without overwhelming.
